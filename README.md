## Essential Math
Math you'll need as you work with data.

In the ideal world, you would know it before landing the first job. However, we all know that the real world isn't even capable of assessing this knowledge, they can only assess the results, and the early career results in most places won't need deep math knowledge.

That means you should study math as you go, and keep studying it while focusing on delivering better results as you learn more and more.

### freeCodeCamp
You can't go wrong with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). They have many awesome resources on software engineering, data analysis, machine learning and many other code related topics.

## SQL
All databases talk SQL, even the NoSQL ones.

### PostgresSQL

* [PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/)

### Tutorial "family"
I'm calling it "family" because all the sites listed below follow the same template to teach how to SQL. However, the main difference is the engine behind each tutorial, and that means a few important differences in how to install and to manage it while also having some differences in certains SQL expressions.

* [Db2 Tutorial](https://www.db2tutorial.com/)
* [MySQL Tutorial](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/)
* [Oracle Tutorial](https://www.oracletutorial.com/)
* [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/)
* [SQL Server Tutorial](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/)

## Python
Python is the _lingua franca_ of data science. Learn it!

### API development
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a great web framework for development of APIs that is easy to code, test and debug. It also come with great [tutorial and learning resources](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/learn/) written by the FastAPI team as an official and recommended way to learn FastAPI.

I have built a landing page powered by FastAPI as an example ([here](https://github.com/BreytMN/acme-rockets)'s the source code). It is also live [here](https://portfolio.breytmn.com/acme_rockets).
